To count the total number of good segments in a range 
a[l....r] such that a[l'....r'] is also good
where l'>l and r'<r 
So suppose our current ans includes all the good segments in l'..........r'
but now we move to the right that is r and our current segment is good 
so our ans will be increased by r-l'+1
these are the number of new segments added to ans which are also good

Codeforces edu:
C. Number of Segments with Small Sum 
D. Number of Segments with Big Sum
	-Different variation, here if the smaller segment is good then all the bigger
	segments are also good. So in such a case we add to ans n-r 
	which means all the segments apart from current segment
