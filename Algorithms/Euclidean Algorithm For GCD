if g divides a and g divides b
then g divides a-b also
using this we can compute gcd as
GCD(a,b) = GCD(a,a-b)
or GCD(a,b) = GCD(a,a%b) since we can further reduce a-b by subtracting b as many times as possible

Time Complexity: O(log(min(a,b)))

PROPERTIES OF GCD;
GCD(a,0) = a
GCD(2a,2b) = 2 GCD(a,b)
GCD(2a,b) = GCD(a,b)
