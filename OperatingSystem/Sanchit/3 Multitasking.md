# MULTITASKING OPERATING SYSTEM
Also known as Time Sharing/Fair Share/Multiprogramming with Round Robin

* Multitasking is programming with time sharing
* Only one CPU but it switches between processes so quickly that it creates illusion that all processes are executing at same time
* The task in multitasking may refer to multiple threads of the program
* Main idea is better response time and executing multiple process together




# Multiprocessing Operating System
* More than one CPU in a single computer 
* Increases reliability
* Better throughput
* Lesser process starvation, if one CPU is working on some process than other CPU can work on other processes
