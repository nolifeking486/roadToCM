# Network Models

* **Layered Task**: International Standard Organisation proposed an Open System Interconnection model which allows two systems to communicate with each other regardless of their architecture

* The OSI model is not a protocol. It is a model for understanding and designing a network architecture that is robust, flexible and interoperable
* It consists of seven separate but related layers each of which defines a part of the process of moving information across a network

## Physical Layer

* The physical layer defines the characteristics of the interface between the devices and the transmission medium
* **Representation of bits** : The physical layer data consists of a stream of bits with no interpolation. For transmission, bits must be encoded into signals- electrical or optical
* **Data transmission rate** is also defined by the physical layer
* **Line Configuration**: Type of connection of the devices to the media (point to point, multipoint)
* **Physical Topology** is depends on physical layer
* **Transmission Mode**: Simplex, Half Duplex, Full Duplex is also defined by physical layer
