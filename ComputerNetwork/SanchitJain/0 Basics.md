# COMPUTER NETWORK SANCHIT JAIN

## What is computer network?
- A computer network is a telecommunications network which allows digital devices(nodes) to exchange data between each other using wired or wireless connections to share resources (hardware or software)
- A collection of autonomous computers interconnected by a single technology

## What is Data Communication?
- Exchange of data between 2 devices via some tranmission medium

## Components of Data Communication?
- Message - Info to be commmunicated
- Sender - device who sends the message
- Receiver - device which receives the message
- Transmission Medium - physical path by which message travels
- Protocol - Set of rules that govern the data communication

## Fundamental Characteristics for Effectiveness?
- Delivery - Data must be delivered to correct destination
- Accuracy - Accurately without errors
- Timeliness - Within deadline delivery
- Jitter - Uneven delay in packets

## Types of Data Flow:
- Simplex - unidirectional data flow. There will be only one Sender and one Receiver which will be fixed.
- Half Duplex - 2 stations, both can transmit and receive, but only do one of these functions at a time, not simultaneously
  - eg. Walkie Talkie
- Full Duplex - Both stations can transmit and receive at the same time. There are 2 half duplex connections established.


## Types of Connection:
- Point to Point - A dedicated link between 2 devices. No other device can use this connection.
- Multipoint - More than 2 specific devices share a connection. Also called multidrop.
